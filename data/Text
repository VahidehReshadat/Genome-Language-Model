"SUPPOSING that Truth is. a woman--what then? Is there not ground
for suspecting that all. philosophers, in so far as they have been
dogmatists, have failed to understand women--that the terrible
seriousness and. clumsy.. importunity with which they have usually paid
their addresses to Truth, have been. unskilled and unseemly methods for
winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and
at present. every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien--IF,
indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it
has fallen, that all dogma lies on the. ground--nay more, that it is at
its last gasp.
13. Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the
instinct of. self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic
being. A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its strength--life
itself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only one of the indirect
and most fre.quent. RESULTS thereof. In short, here, as. everywhere. else,
let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!--one of which
is the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to Spinoza's
inconsistency). It is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must
be essentially economy of principles."
