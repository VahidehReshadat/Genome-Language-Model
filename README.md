## An Attention-based LSTM Neural Model for Predicting DNA Sequences

A Genome Neural Language Model for DNA sequencing that determins the order of nucleic acid sequence by predicting the next nucleotides in DNA.
The goal is to predict the next nucleotide by using the current nucleotides. I trained an attention-based LSTM model to predict the next token or next few tokens in the nucleic acid sequence using the previous tokens as input. The network is trained to generate the most possible (n+1)-th nucleotide regarding the input sequence of n nucleotides.
